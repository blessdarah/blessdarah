👋🏿 Hi, my name is Bless Darah, or you can call me Darah-B

👨🏿‍💻 I'm a fullstack developer from 🇨🇲 Cameroon. My country is the only Bilingual country on the continent of Africa speaking 🇫🇷French and 🇬🇧English as official languages.

😉 But you know what, I speak mainly 🇬🇧English and can understand a little bit of French.

📚 My stack is very wide. I code fluently in (CSS, SASS, HTML are by default) JavaScript, ReactJs, Node, PHP and Laravel.

✍️ I also know and can code in Python and C#
