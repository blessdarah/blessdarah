👋🏿 Hi, my name is Bless Darah, or you can call me Darah-B

👨🏿‍💻 I'm a fullstack developer from 🇨🇲 Cameroon. My country is the only Bilingual country on the continent of Africa speaking 🇫🇷French and 🇬🇧English as official languages.

👷 I currently work at a local hospital where I contribute in building hospital systems to manage processes and financial tracking application for expencies within the various facilities. And also I work as a **Tutor** with [CareerFoundy](https://careerfoundry.com) where I help students learn the skills they need in web development to be job ready within 6 months or less.

😉 But you know what, I speak mainly 🇬🇧English and can understand a little bit of French.

📚 My stack is very wide. I code fluently in (CSS, SASS, HTML are by default) JavaScript/Typescript, ReactJs, Node, PHP and Laravel.

✍️ I also know and can code in Python (for fun or teaching young devs) and C#/.NET core (for office work in building web APIs)
